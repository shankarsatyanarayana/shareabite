Share a Bite is a platform dedicated to reducing food waste and helping those in need by facilitating the sharing of leftover food from events and function halls.

Our mission is to connect function hall managers with individuals who can collect and distribute surplus food to communities and individuals who may benefit from it.

By participating in Share a Bite, you can contribute to the fight against hunger and make a positive impact on both the environment and society.
